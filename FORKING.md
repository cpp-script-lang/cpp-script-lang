# Thank you for your interest in this project
So, you want to create your own edition of C++Script, right?
First, please read the latest specification before you start implementing it. Of course, you can add some extensions, but they should be disabled-by-default (user has to use option --enable-extensions or something like this).
Then, please create a PR with link to your implementation in README.md in the section Community implementations.
If you need help create new discussion here with the category Forking with title from this template:
```
Fork by <your username> [<target>]
```
Where `<target>` can be:
- preproccessor (set of macros)
- transpiler
- native
- interpreter
- LLVM
- CVM
- .NET
- JVM
- Rubinius VM
Are there other VMs? (Please create PR with new VMs)
